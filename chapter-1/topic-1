Microservices

Microservices, or microservice architecture, is an approach to designing and organizing software applications as a set of independently deployable services. These services are designed to be loosely interconnected, allowing for flexibility and scalability.
In this architectural style, the application is broken down into small, self-contained services that encapsulate specific business functionalities. 
Each service is developed, deployed, and maintained by a dedicated, small-scale development team.

The essence of microservices lies in their ability to operate independently, reducing dependencies between different components. 
This modular approach enables organizations to accelerate the development and deployment of large, intricate applications. 
The emphasis on autonomy and separation of concerns allows for rapid, frequent, reliable, and sustainable delivery of softwareâ€”a crucial advantage in the competitive landscape of the contemporary business world.
